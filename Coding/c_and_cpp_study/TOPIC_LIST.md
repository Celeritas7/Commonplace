# Interactive Books — Topic List for C and C++ Study

**Project:** Interactive books for studying C and C++
**Author:** Aniket
**Last updated:** 2026-05-25 (revised for beginner audience)

## Design Decisions

These decisions shape every chapter:

- **Audience:** Complete beginner — no prior programming experience assumed.
- **Depth:** Practical working knowledge. We cover what a working developer
  uses; we skip or briefly mention rarely-used corners.
- **Standards baseline:** C99 for the C book, C++11 for the C++ book. Features
  added in later standards are marked, e.g. **(C++17)**, **(C++20)**.
- **Book linkage:** The two books are independent. A reader of either book gets
  the full story without needing the other. Shared foundations (control flow,
  basic I/O) appear in both, written for that book's context.

## Pedagogy — Every Chapter Follows This Pattern

Because the reader is a complete beginner, every lesson uses the same
seven-part structure so the experience is predictable:

1. **Why this matters** — one paragraph motivating the topic with a concrete scenario.
2. **The mental model** — diagrams and an analogy before any code.
3. **Walk-through** — line-by-line annotated code, very small example.
4. **Try it** — embedded code editor with starter code the reader edits.
5. **Predict the output** — short interactive quiz before the answer is revealed.
6. **Common mistakes** — the two or three things beginners get wrong here.
7. **Exercises** — three graded problems (easy / medium / stretch).

A **"Quick recap"** card closes each lesson with bullet takeaways.

Legend for **Status** column:
- **Have** — substantial coverage exists in your current files
- **Partial** — some material exists but is incomplete
- **New** — needs to be written fresh

## Topics Intentionally Left Out (or Briefly Mentioned Only)

To stay at "practical working knowledge," these are *not* full chapters:

- **C:** `register`, deep `goto` patterns, manual `setjmp`/`longjmp`, K&R-style declarations, signal handlers in depth, full `<locale.h>`, threading (C11)
- **C++:** variadic templates, template metaprogramming, custom allocators, coroutines (C++20), modules (C++20) in depth, full concurrency / atomics / memory model, vtable internals, exception specifications history, full C++ Core Guidelines

These can be a future "Volume 2" once the main book is done.

## Cross-Book Appendices (each book ships with its own copy)

| # | Topic |
|---|---|
| A | ASCII table |
| B | Number systems and a primer on bitwise tricks |
| C | Reading a compiler error message — worked examples |
| D | Glossary of jargon |
| E | One-page cheatsheets — operators, format specifiers, STL containers (C++ only) |
| F | Where to go next — recommended books, websites, communities |

## Source-Material Map (what we already have)

- **C++_language_R001.pdf / C_&_C++_A4_R000.pdf** — strong source for Book 2
  Parts IV (functions), VI (OOP), VII (inheritance/polymorphism), IX (templates,
  basics), X (exceptions), XI.2 (file streams). Chapters tagged **Have** above.
- **C_trying_to_generate_book.pdf** — only useful for Book 1 Part II (variables,
  constants, keywords). The rest of that PDF is unrelated SQL content and
  should be discarded.
- **C_Complete_Notes.pdf** — image-based, 75 scanned pages, no extractable
  text. Visual reference only.
- **ref/Effective Modern C++** (Scott Meyers) — best secondary source for
  Book 2 Part VIII (RAII, move semantics, smart pointers) and Part IX (modern
  template features).
- **ref/0321714113Cplus2.pdf** — broad C++ reference, useful across Parts II–VII.
